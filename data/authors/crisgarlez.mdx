Hello, my name is Cristhian García, I am a Systems Engineer with several years of experience as a Full Stack Developer with more inclination for Backend development.

I like learning about technology, especially programming, software architecture, and cloud computing. Outside of technology, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing retro video games and board games.

I made this blog with the purpose of sharing what I have learned and give it back to the community.
